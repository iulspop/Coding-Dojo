Meetup

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.

Examples of general descriptions are:

    The first Monday of January 2017
    The third Tuesday of January 2017
    The wednesteenth of January 2017
    The last Thursday of January 2017

The descriptors you are expected to parse are: first, second, third, fourth, fifth, last, monteenth, tuesteenth, wednesteenth, thursteenth, friteenth, saturteenth, sunteenth

Note that "Monteenth", "Tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There was a meetup whose members realised that there are exactly 7 days that end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth' in every month.

Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and descriptor calculate the date of the actual meetup. For example, if given "The first Monday of January 2017", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2.
